# Shadow-Removal
The working code here is code3_3. The project was done by me as Course Project during my 6th semester at IIT Mandi.
I have followed the following papers:
1) https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/111781/files/piecewise_shadows.pdf
2) http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.5.7776&rep=rep1&type=pdf

As a piece of advice to anyone working on shadow removal. Please use raw image if possible. You might not get expected result due to compressions.
With the code I was able to generate a good 1D image. For edge detection we have to tweak the code according to our need.
